Rough Requirements of tool:

-Host webapp/tool online - find place to do it

-Scrape advertising info from website metadata (if possible) - Scrapey?
  -If scraping this info is not possible/accurate/etc, look into OCR (optical character recognition) 
   for identifying advertisers on Fake News Websites
  -Included info:
      -What advertisers are buying ads on sites
      -How many ads (per day, etc) are being shown on sites - way to count engagements
      -What website/article/etc is ad being shown on
      -(Lower Priority) - what company bought adspace to sell to ad-buying companies (middlemen)
      
-Store/structure this data somehow so it's easily analyzable

-Build tool/dashboard that displays/summarizes this info

-Find contact info of companies that are advertising on these sites - find ways to contact companies
 and publicize their adverts
